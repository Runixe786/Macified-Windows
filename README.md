So this is how the final look on your windows desktop will come out. Its always subject to the amount of customisations you do. If you follow instructions as given below in every segment, you will accomplish the same as in screenshots below:

# Themes

**Step 1**: extract the zip file and you will find a file called ThemePatcher. Open it, give permissions and patch the "Themeui" and "uxinit" by clicking on install button. Let it do its work. when its done, it will ask to reboot your pc which you gotta do. 

**Step 2**: After rebooting, go to same folder and find the Themes zip file. Extract it, and go to following path: Themes_MacifiedWindows\macOS for Windows 11 22H2 - Mar 12 2023. In this folder you will find a folder called "Windows 11 22H2 Themes". Copy all files inside it and paste it to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes folder.

**Step 3**: Go to settings>personalisation>themes and select the 2nd dark theme of MacOS (MacOS-dark solid, 6 images) as first one has some bugs. Apply and with this, you will notice some changes in UI elements. 

Lets move ahead to wallpapers now :) 
 
# Wallpapers

Setting the MacOS Wallpaper in beginning will start giving you a vibe of it so you dont get lazy and bored while doing all steps. So go download the zip file of wallpapers or if you have downloaded the full package, you can simply find wallpapers zip inside it. extract it and choose any wallpaper which suits your taste. 

i added around 50+ high quality wallpapers originally extracted from MacOS. These are my favs so you dont have to look out for more. 
still incase you dont like them or dont wanna spend 200mb on walpaper alone, [you can get individual files here](https://t.me/macOSWallpaper)

# Rainmeter widgets

Firstly you have to setup rainmeter app. Download it from [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/) and install it. 

open the Macified Windows folder and look for widgets file (rmskin extension) . Double click on it and simply install the widgets. 

These widgets are already set according to the values i have filled (size and position) . Incase they dont load on their own after installing, open rainmeter app, select Macified windows from sidebar, expand it and load individual widgets seprately as per your choice.

**Note:** These widgets belong to different rainmeter skins i found from various sources. i combined all of them into one and removed those which arent useful. There might be some bugs in it related to settings. But you can easily change their shape by right clicking on widget and choosing "alternative" option. You can change their position too by dragging them (double click + hold + drag).

Note: This is my first rainmeter project so this package include some basic skins only. i will update this widgets package with more skins as i learn more. You can also suggest rainmeter widgets of macOS style you want to add in this skin (do provide link of that existing skin you wish to add it in this widget pack) 

# Dock and menu bar

This is the most demanded thing.So yes, lets get started.

**Step 1**: Extract the dock_MacifiedWindows.rar file. There will be "dock_macifiedwindows" folder which you gotta open. Again same folder (same name) will appear and open it again. (sorry for this duplication, i forgot to fix)

**Step 2**: Inside that folder, there will be many folders and files. Find the dock_64.exe file or dock.exe and open it. 

**Step 3**: Boom, thats it. Dock and menu bar will appear. 

_You will notice taskbar overlaying on dock or menu bar not appeared. So you have to change some settings_ 

**Step 4**: Bring your mouse over dock and right click on some empty space. Select "preferences" from the list that appears which will open a settings page.

**Step 5**: Open advanced settings on sidebar (leftside) and scroll to last where you will find an option called "dock layout backup". Open the drop down list there and select "Macified Windows". It will ask to restore that backup and then the app will restart itself. Thats all, your dock is now fully setup 

**Note**: You might notice that some applications on dock dont open. This is because they arent installed in your PC/laptop. You can remove that icon and add your favourite ones. Menubar doesnt need much changes. you can customise it as per your likings. 
 
# Stage Manager

Open preferences option as you did in step 4 of [Dock and menu bar](Dock-and-menu-bar). Keep the same settings as shown in screenshot below
